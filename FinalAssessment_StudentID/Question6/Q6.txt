(a)
    For 1) No Wrap: 
        My assignment can already handle this. The top layer of the numbers is connected to the bottom layer of the numbers 
        and the space and backspace keys would be connected one directionally from the three keys below it so the key itself and bi-directionally 
        back to the key directly below (i.e. 'b' for spacebar and 'f' for backspace)

    For 2) No Wrap:
        As you enter the string into the keyboard, the assignment code would cross-reference the input with an array of known values
        to compare against. The top of the suggested 'list' would connect an edge with the bottom row of the original keyboard ('123', '#-!', Backspace)
        and each suggested list entry would share an edge with the entry above and below itself 

(b)
    Because keyboard 1) works exactly as my assignment does, using my assignment would give an approximate demonstration of the keyboard performance. 
    You can also assume that keyboard 1) will be faster than keyboard 2) in terms of performance.

    For keyboard 2), due to the nature of continually cross-referencing an external data structure to check for suggestions, the performance would be a lot slower.

(c)
    This strategy could be supported by assignment. Essentially, this could be replicated by just removing the vertexes faded out in the example,
    this vertex removal is a method that was required for the assignment and so it would be easy to implement. In terms of determining which vertexes to delete,
    my assignment already pre-checks the desired string before traversing and so it could nullify any uneccesary vertexes after pre-check.
