For 1) No Wrap: 
    My assignment can already handle this. The top layer of the numbers is connected to the bottom layer of the numbers 
    and the space and backspace keys would be connected one directionally from the three keys below it so the key itself and bi-directionally 
    back to the key directly below (i.e. 'b' for spacebar and 'f' for backspace)

For 2) No Wrap:
    As you enter the string into the keyboard, the assignment code would cross-reference the input with an array of known values
    to compare against. The top of the suggested 'list' would connect an edge with the bottom row of the original keyboard ('123', '#-!', Backspace)
    and each suggested list entry would share an edge with the entry above and below itself
