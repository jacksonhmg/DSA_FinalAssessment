Theoretical Analysis:
    Theoretically the hash table should be faster in performance as a hash table is optimised to handle large amounts of data with exact keys given.
    A binary search tree, on the other hand, is not optimised to handle this large amount of data.

Actual Analysis:
    Using the inputs: "Movie" and "Jane Eyre":
        HashTable has an average time taken of 130microseconds
        BinarySearchTree has an average time taken of 27000microseconds
    Using the inputs: "Actor" and "Jamie Bell":
        HashTable has an average time taken of 80microseconds
        BinarySearchTree has an average time taken of 2100microseconds
    Using the inputs: "Role" and "Dad":
        HashTable has an average time taken of 50microseconds
        BinarySearchTree has an average time taken of 1300microseconds

As we can see, the HashTable is superior across all fields.
