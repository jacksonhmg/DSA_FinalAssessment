Normal BST
    There are 3 cases to consider when deleting a node:
        The node to be deleted has no children
        The node to be deleted has one child
        The node to be deleted has two children
    If the node has no children, you simply nullify the parent's link and "delete" it
    If the node has one child, have the child of the deleted node become connected to the deleted node's parent (i.e. have the orphan become adopted by the parent)
    If the node has two children, find the successor for the deleted node. The successor is the left most of right-sub tree and then replace the deleted node with the sucessor node

Red-Black Tree
    If the node to be deleted is a red node with no children, simply remove the parent link and delete the node
    If the node to be deleted is a black node with no children, delete the node and refactor the tree to maintain the black-height and almost-complete rules of a red-black tree
    If the node to be deleted is a black node with one child, have the child of the deleted node become connected to the deleted node's parent (i.e. have the orphan become adopted by the parent)
    If the node to be deleted is a red node with two children, replace the node to be deleted with its successor (the right most node of its left-sub tree)
    If the node to be deleted is a black node with two children, replace the node to be deleted with its successor (the right most node of its left-sub tree)
    
2-3-4 Tree
    If node to be deleted is in a group consisting of at least 2 nodes, delete node.
    If node to be deleted is in a group, is the middle node and left child has at least 2 nodes, replace node to be deleted with its predecessor
    If node to be deleted is in a group, is the middle node and right child has at least 2 nodes, replace node to be deleted with its successor
    If node to be deleted is in a group, is the middle node and both left/right nodes have only 1 node, merge left and right child
    If node to be deleted is in a group, is not the middle node, the child group has only 1 node and another child group has at least 2 nodes, move parent to group with only 1 node and move node from child group with at least 2 nodes into parent group
    If node to be deleted is in a group, is not the middle node, and all child groups have only 1 node, merge child groups and move node from parent to new merged group to become the middle node

B-Tree
    If the node to be deleted has no children, simply remove the parents link and delete the node
    If the node to be deleted has 3 children (one shared with another node), remove it and combine two of its children into one depending on which node you deleted (the higher or lower of the pair)
    If the node to be deleted has 2 children, replace it with the right mode node of the left child
